Description: This workshop will give an overview of existing methods and implementations for enrichment analysis of functional gene groups such as gene sets, pathways, and networks. Participants will be introduced in statistical theory of frequently used gene set testing methods, emphasizing on underlying differences in hypotheses and individual limitations. Based on that, hands-on examples will be carried out using a selection of established Bioconductor packages, which have shown to work well in practice. This will equip participants with functionality for data preparation, preprocessing, differential expression analysis, set- and network-based enrichment analysis, combination as well as visualization and exploration of results. As an outlook, the workshop will also cover current developments of extending gene set enrichment analysis for data derived from multiple genomic high-throughput assays. Specific prior knowledge is not needed, basic skills in data manipulation with R are beneficial.
