Description: Overview of existing methods for enrichment analysis of gene expression 
	data with regard to functional gene sets, pathways, and networks. Functionality for 
	differential expression analysis, set- and network-based enrichment analysis, along 
	with visualization and exploration of results. Introduction to concepts for enrichment 
	analysis of genomic regions and regulatory elements. Outlook on current developments 
	to extend gene set enrichment analysis for data derived from multiple high-throughput 
	omics assays.
